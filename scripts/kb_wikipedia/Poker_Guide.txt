Casino poker differs from traditional poker - you play against the house, not other players. These games combine poker hand rankings with casino-style betting for exciting gameplay.

Video Poker Basics:
Video poker machines let you play draw poker against a paytable. You're dealt 5 cards, choose which to keep, and draw replacements. Winning hands pay according to the displayed paytable.

Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest):
1. Royal Flush: A-K-Q-J-10 same suit (rarest, highest payout)
2. Straight Flush: Five sequential cards same suit
3. Four of a Kind: Four cards of same rank
4. Full House: Three of a kind plus a pair
5. Flush: Five cards same suit
6. Straight: Five sequential cards any suit
7. Three of a Kind: Three cards same rank
8. Two Pair: Two different pairs
9. Jacks or Better: Pair of Jacks, Queens, Kings, or Aces
10. High Card: No combination (usually no payout)
