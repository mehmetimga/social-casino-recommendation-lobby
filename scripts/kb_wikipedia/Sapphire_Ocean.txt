Sapphire Ocean takes players on a breathtaking underwater adventure to the deepest parts of the ocean where legendary treasures sparkle in the sapphire depths. This beautifully designed slot features marine life, sunken ships, and mysterious ocean caves filled with precious gems.

Game Mechanics:
5 reels, 3 rows with 20 paylines provide a classic slot structure. The game features Stacked Wilds that can cover entire reels, creating opportunities for massive multi-line wins. Wins are evaluated from left to right and right to left, doubling winning chances.

RTP and Volatility:
Sapphire Ocean offers 96.1% RTP with medium volatility. The both-ways pay feature helps maintain consistent action while the stacked wilds provide big win potential.

Ocean Theme and Symbols:
Crystal-clear graphics showcase beautiful sea creatures including dolphins, sea turtles, colorful tropical fish, and majestic manta rays. The Sapphire Mermaid serves as the premium wild symbol, while the Treasure Chest acts as the scatter. Precious gems (sapphires, pearls, and coral) represent mid-tier symbols.

Stacked Mermaid Wilds:
The Sapphire Mermaid wild appears stacked on reels 2, 3, and 4. When a full stack lands, it triggers the Mermaid's Blessing - a random multiplier between 2x and 5x applied to all wins on that spin.

Treasure Dive Free Spins:
Landing 3 or more Treasure Chest scatters awards 10 free spins. During free spins, additional wild symbols are added to the reels, and all Mermaid's Blessing multipliers are doubled (4x to 10x).

Sunken Ship Bonus:
Randomly triggered during base game, the Sunken Ship bonus reveals a ship's treasure hold. Players select from treasure items to reveal coin prizes, multipliers, or free spin awards.

Deep Dive Feature:
A depth meter on the side of the screen fills with each win. When full, it triggers the Deep Dive feature, taking players to an underwater cave where a picking game reveals hidden sapphire treasures.

Visual and Audio:
Stunning underwater visuals with realistic water effects, floating bubbles, and gentle sea currents. The serene oceanic soundtrack features whale songs and gentle wave sounds, creating a relaxing yet engaging atmosphere.

Sapphire Ocean offers a maximum win of 2,000x your bet, achievable through full wild reels combined with maximum Mermaid's Blessing multipliers during free spins.
