Slot machines are the most popular games in social casinos worldwide. Understanding how they work enhances your gaming experience and helps you make informed choices.

How Modern Slots Work:
Modern video slots use Random Number Generators (RNG) to ensure every spin is independent and fair. Each symbol on each reel has an equal chance of appearing, and previous spins have no impact on future results.

Key Slot Terminology:

RTP (Return to Player): The theoretical percentage returned to players over time. A 96% RTP means the slot returns $96 for every $100 wagered on average over millions of spins.

Volatility (Variance): How risky a slot is. Low volatility slots pay frequently but smaller amounts. High volatility slots pay less often but with bigger wins. Medium volatility offers balanced gameplay.

Paylines: The patterns across reels where matching symbols create wins. Modern slots can have anywhere from 1 to thousands of ways to win.

Wild Symbols: Substitute for other symbols to create winning combinations. Expanding wilds cover entire reels. Sticky wilds remain in place for multiple spins.

Scatter Symbols: Trigger bonus features regardless of where they land. Usually activate free spins or bonus games.

Bonus Features:
- Free Spins: Play rounds without betting, winnings are added to your balance
- Multipliers: Increase wins by 2x, 3x, 5x, or even 100x+
- Pick-and-Win: Choose items to reveal prizes
- Wheel of Fortune: Spin a wheel for random rewards
- Cascading Reels: Winning symbols disappear, new ones drop down

Popular Slot Types:

Classic Slots: 3 reels, simple gameplay, nostalgic fruit machine style. Usually 1-5 paylines. Great for beginners.

Megaways Slots: Dynamic reel system with up to 117,649 ways to win. Every spin changes the number of symbols per reel.

Progressive Jackpots: A portion of each bet contributes to a growing jackpot that one lucky player will eventually win.
