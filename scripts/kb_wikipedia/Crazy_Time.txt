Crazy Time by Evolution Gaming is the ultimate live casino game show experience. This revolutionary game combines the excitement of a money wheel with four incredible bonus games, creating an entertainment spectacle unlike anything else in online casinos.

Game Mechanics:
The Crazy Time wheel features 54 segments with numbers 1, 2, 5, and 10, plus four bonus game segments: Coin Flip, Pachinko, Cash Hunt, and the spectacular Crazy Time bonus round. A live host spins the wheel in a vibrant studio filled with augmented reality effects.

Bonus Games Explained:

1. Coin Flip - A simple but thrilling game where a coin is flipped with two multipliers (red and blue). The side that lands face-up determines your multiplier, which can reach up to 50x.

2. Pachinko - A massive vertical Pachinko board where a puck drops through pegs, landing in a multiplier slot at the bottom. Multipliers range from 10x to 10,000x.

3. Cash Hunt - An interactive shooting gallery featuring 108 multipliers hidden behind symbols. Players aim and shoot to reveal their multiplier, with potential wins up to 500x.

4. Crazy Time - The main bonus round featuring a giant virtual wheel with three flappers (red, blue, yellow). Each flapper can double or triple all multipliers. This bonus can award massive wins with multipliers potentially reaching 20,000x.

Betting Strategy:
Players can bet on numbers (1, 2, 5, 10) or any of the four bonus games. Bonus games appear less frequently but offer bigger multiplier potential. Many players spread bets across multiple segments to increase chances of hitting bonuses.

What Makes It Special:
The combination of live entertainment, augmented reality, and huge win potential makes Crazy Time the most popular live casino game worldwide. The charismatic hosts, stunning visuals, and constant action keep players engaged round after round.
