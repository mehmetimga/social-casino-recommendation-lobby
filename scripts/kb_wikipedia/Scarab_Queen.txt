Game Structure:
5 reels, 4 rows, and 50 paylines set within an underground tomb filled with golden treasures. The expanded 4-row format provides more winning combinations than standard slots.

Scarab Swarm Feature:
The signature mechanic sees scarab beetles crawl across the reels after non-winning spins. Each beetle transforms one symbol into another, potentially creating unexpected wins. The more consecutive non-winning spins, the more beetles appear.

Expanding Scarab Queen:
When the Scarab Queen wild lands, she expands to fill her entire reel and remains sticky for 1-3 re-spins. Multiple queens can expand simultaneously, creating massive win potential.

Tomb of Riches Free Spins:
Landing 3 or more Golden Scarab scatters triggers 12 free spins. During free spins:
- The Scarab Queen appears more frequently
- All queens remain sticky until the feature ends
- A progressive multiplier increases with each queen that lands

Treasure Chamber Bonus:
Randomly triggered when a special chamber symbol appears. Players navigate through tomb chambers, choosing doors to reveal prizes or advance deeper. Reaching the final chamber awards the Scarab Queen Mega Prize.

High Volatility Strategy:
Scarab Queen is designed for players who can handle extended dry spells in exchange for explosive winning potential. Budget for 200+ spins and be prepared for the thrilling free spins where multiple sticky queens can transform modest bets into significant wins.

Maximum Win:
8,500x your bet, typically achieved through free spins with 4-5 sticky Scarab Queens and accumulated multipliers.
