Legacy of Dead by Play'n GO is a premium entry in the "Book of" slot genre, featuring Egyptian exploration and expanding symbol free spins. Released in 2020, it continues the tradition of Book of Dead while offering its own identity and solid 96.58% RTP.

Game Mechanics:
5 reels, 3 rows, 10 paylines. Classic structure that fans of Book of Dead and Book of Ra will immediately recognize. The special expanding symbol during free spins drives the big win potential.

RTP and Volatility:
96.58% RTP with high volatility. Standard for the genre - expect long dry spells punctuated by potentially massive feature wins.

Theme and Design:
Ancient Egyptian adventure featuring a pharaoh protagonist exploring golden tombs. Hieroglyphic symbols, golden artifacts, and pyramid chambers create authentic atmosphere. High production values with smooth animations.

Symbol Values:
- Pharaoh: Highest regular symbol
- Anubis: High value
- Bird (Horus): High value
- Scarab: Medium value
- A, K, Q, J, 10: Low value card symbols
- Book Scatter/Wild: Substitutes for all, triggers bonus

Scatter/Wild Book Symbol:
The golden book serves dual purposes:
- Wild: Substitutes for any symbol
- Scatter: 3+ anywhere triggers free spins
- Can create wins on its own (5 books = top payout)

Free Spins Feature:
Triggered by 3+ Book Scatters:
- 3 Scatters: 8 free spins
- 4 Scatters: 12 free spins
- 5 Scatters: 20 free spins

Expanding Special Symbol:
Before free spins begin:
1. Book pages flip through symbols
2. One symbol randomly selected as Special Symbol
3. This symbol EXPANDS during free spins

How Expansion Works:
When the Special Symbol lands:
- Expands to cover entire reel(s)
- Pays on all 10 paylines
- Creates multiple simultaneous wins
- Even non-adjacent wins count

This can turn a single symbol appearance into a screen-filling win.

Multiple Special Symbols:
Legacy of Dead can award up to 3 special symbols:
- Retrigger with 3+ scatters during free spins
- Each retrigger adds new special symbol
- Multiple special symbols = explosive potential
- All special symbols expand when they land

Maximum Win:
5,000x bet through multiple expanding special symbols covering the reels.

Strategy Considerations:
1. Base game can be very quiet
2. Book symbols are key - they trigger everything
3. Free spins determine session outcome
4. High-value expanding symbols (Pharaoh, Anubis) are best
5. Retriggering for multiple specials is the dream

Bankroll Guidelines:
- Minimum: 200x bet
- Comfortable: 400x bet
- Recommended: 600x bet
