Live baccarat brings the elegance of high-roller rooms directly to your screen. Professional dealers, real cards, and sophisticated settings create an authentic luxury casino experience. It's the preferred game of VIPs worldwide, now accessible to everyone.

How Live Baccarat Works:
Real dealers in professional studios manage the game using physical cards. Multiple camera angles capture every moment - from the squeeze to the reveal. You bet digitally while watching the drama unfold in real-time.

Game Flow:
1. Betting period opens (typically 15-20 seconds)
2. Place bets on Player, Banker, or Tie
3. Optional side bets available
4. Dealer draws cards following strict rules
5. Winning bets paid automatically
6. New round begins

Baccarat Basics Refresher:
- Two hands dealt: Player and Banker
- Goal: Bet on which hand totals closest to 9
- Card values: Ace=1, 2-9=face value, 10/J/Q/K=0
- Totals over 9 use only second digit (15 becomes 5)
- Drawing rules are automatic, no decisions needed

Main Bets:
- Player: Pays 1:1, house edge 1.24%
- Banker: Pays 0.95:1 (5% commission), house edge 1.06%
- Tie: Pays 8:1 or 9:1, house edge 14%+

Banker bet is statistically the best option.

Popular Live Baccarat Variants:

Standard Live Baccarat:
Classic format with single dealer. Clean, professional presentation.

Speed Baccarat:
Faster rounds (27 seconds vs 48 seconds). Cards dealt face up immediately. No squeeze ritual.

Baccarat Squeeze:
Dramatic card reveals. Dealer slowly peels back cards for suspense. Traditional high-roller experience.

No Commission Baccarat:
No 5% commission on Banker wins. Instead, Banker 6 pays 50% (creates similar house edge).

Lightning Baccarat (Evolution):
Random multipliers (up to 512x) applied each round. 20% lightning fee on bets. Higher house edge but massive potential wins.

Dragon Tiger:
Simplified version. One card each to Dragon and Tiger. Bet on which is higher. Very fast.

Peek Baccarat:
Players vote to control card reveal. Interactive element adds engagement.

Multi-Camera Baccarat:
Multiple viewing angles. Switch between wide shot, close-ups, and player cameras.

The Squeeze Ritual:
In squeeze variants:
- Dealer slowly reveals card edges
- Builds tension with each reveal
- Traditional high-roller practice
- Most authentic baccarat experience

Side Bets Explained:

Player/Banker Pair: First two cards are a pair (11:1)
Either Pair: Either hand gets a pair (5:1)
Perfect Pair: Same rank and suit (25:1)
Big/Small: Total cards dealt (Big=5-6 cards, Small=4 cards)
Player/Banker Bonus: Winning margin side bets
Dragon Bonus: Natural winner or 4+ point margin

Side bet house edges are typically 2-13%, higher than main game.

Understanding Commissions:
Traditional: 5% commission on Banker wins

- Tracked and deducted at table change or round end

No Commission:
