Live dealer blackjack combines the convenience of online gaming with the authentic experience of a real casino. Professional dealers, real cards, and real-time streaming create an immersive atmosphere that's as close to Vegas as you can get from home.

How Live Blackjack Works:
Real dealers operate from professional studios or land-based casinos. Multiple HD cameras capture every angle. You place bets digitally while watching the action unfold in real-time. Chat features let you interact with dealers and sometimes other players.

Game Flow:
1. Join a table with available seats
2. Place your bet during betting period
3. Dealer deals physical cards
4. Make decisions (hit, stand, double, split)
5. Watch dealer complete their hand
6. Winnings paid automatically

Blackjack Basics Refresher:
Goal: Get closer to 21 than dealer without busting
Card Values: 2-10 face value, J/Q/K = 10, Ace = 1 or 11
Blackjack: Ace + 10-value card = automatic win (pays 3:2 or 6:5)
Bust: Going over 21 = instant loss

Player Options:
- Hit: Take another card
- Stand: Keep current hand
- Double Down: Double bet, receive one card only
- Split: Separate matching cards into two hands
- Insurance: Side bet when dealer shows Ace
- Surrender: Give up half bet (some tables)

Basic Strategy Highlights:
- Always split Aces and 8s
- Never split 10s or 5s
- Double on 11 against dealer 2-10
- Double on 10 against dealer 2-9
- Stand on 17+ (hard totals)
- Hit on soft 17 (A+6) against dealer 7+

Following basic strategy reduces house edge to approximately 0.5%.
