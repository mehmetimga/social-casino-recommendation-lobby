Strategy Tips:

1. Stick to Outside Bets for Longevity: Even-money bets have best odds with La Partage
2. Agent Seven for Mission Rounds: Cover all three 007 sectors during missions
3. Don't Chase: Each spin is independent
4. Set Win/Loss Limits: Essential for any roulette session
5. Enjoy Mission Rounds: They're the highlight - savor the excitement

La Partage Rule:
On even-money bets (red/black, odd/even, high/low), if the ball lands on zero, you lose only half your bet. This reduces house edge to 1.35% on these bets.
