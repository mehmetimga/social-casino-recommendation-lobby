Diamond Stars is a dazzling classic-style slot that combines nostalgic fruit machine aesthetics with modern features and a brilliant diamond theme. Perfect for players who appreciate traditional slot design with contemporary winning mechanics.

Game Mechanics:
5 reels, 3 rows with 10 paylines offer a straightforward classic slot experience. The game features a Hold and Respin mechanic where diamond symbols trigger special bonus rounds. Simple gameplay is enhanced by the Diamond Collection feature.

RTP and Volatility:
Diamond Stars offers 95.8% RTP with low-medium volatility. This conservative setup provides frequent smaller wins, making it ideal for players who prefer steady gameplay over high-risk sessions.

Classic Symbols with a Twist:
Traditional fruit symbols (cherries, lemons, oranges, plums, grapes) share the reels with BAR symbols and lucky 7s. The Diamond Star symbol is the game's premium wild, and three special diamond colors (blue, pink, yellow) drive the bonus features.

Diamond Collection Feature:
Each diamond that lands adds to a collection meter. Fill the meter with:
- 15 Blue Diamonds: Trigger 5 free spins with sticky wilds
- 20 Pink Diamonds: Trigger Pick bonus with instant prizes
- 25 Yellow Diamonds: Trigger the Diamond Jackpot Spin

Hold and Respin:
When 3 or more diamond symbols land in view, they lock in place and award 3 respins. Additional diamonds extend the feature. Filling all positions with diamonds awards the Star Jackpot.

Star Multiplier:
The Diamond Star wild symbol carries a random multiplier between 2x and 5x. When multiple Diamond Stars contribute to a win, their multipliers multiply together for potentially massive payouts.

Progressive Mini Jackpot:
A portion of each bet contributes to a progressive mini jackpot displayed above the reels. Landing 5 Diamond Star wilds on a payline instantly awards the progressive jackpot.

Visual and Audio:
Clean, modern interpretation of classic slot aesthetics with sparkling diamond effects. Bright colors and smooth animations update the retro feel. The soundtrack features upbeat electronic music with classic slot sound effects.

Maximum Win:
Diamond Stars offers maximum win potential of 1,500x your bet through Diamond Star multiplier combinations or the progressive jackpot, whichever is higher at the time.

Perfect For:
- Classic slot enthusiasts
- Players who prefer low volatility
- Those new to online slots
