Responsible gaming means enjoying casino games as entertainment while maintaining control over your time and spending. This guide helps you develop healthy gaming habits and recognize when gaming might become problematic.

Core Principles of Responsible Gaming:

1. Gaming is Entertainment, Not Income
Casino games are designed for fun, not profit. The house always has an edge. Treat any money spent on gaming as entertainment expense, like going to movies or concerts.

2. Only Play What You Can Afford to Lose
Never gamble with money needed for rent, bills, food, or other essentials. Set aside a specific entertainment budget and never exceed it.

3. Set Limits Before You Play
Decide on time and money limits before starting. Stick to them regardless of whether you're winning or losing.

Setting Effective Limits:

Deposit Limits: Set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit caps. Most casinos offer these tools in account settings.

Loss Limits: Stop playing after losing a predetermined amount. Walking away prevents chasing losses.

Time Limits: Set session length limits. Use timers or alarms as reminders.

Wagering Limits: Cap how much you bet per spin or hand. Lower bets extend playtime.

Session Limits: Decide maximum number of sessions per day/week.

Warning Signs of Problem Gaming:

Financial Signs:
- Spending more than you can afford
- Borrowing money to gamble
- Selling possessions to fund gaming
- Missing bill payments
- Lying about gambling expenses

Behavioral Signs:
- Chasing losses (betting more to recover)
- Unable to stop when planned
- Gaming to escape problems or stress
- Neglecting work, family, or responsibilities
- Feeling restless when not gaming

Emotional Signs:
- Feeling guilty after gaming sessions
- Mood swings related to wins/losses
- Depression or anxiety about gambling
- Obsessive thoughts about gambling
- Using gambling to feel excitement

Self-Assessment Questions:
Ask yourself honestly:
- Do I spend more time/money gaming than intended?
- Has gaming caused relationship problems?
- Do I hide my gaming from others?
- Have I tried to stop but couldn't?
- Do I feel anxious when I can't gamble?
- Do I gamble to escape negative feelings?

If you answered yes to several questions, consider seeking help.

Tools Available to You:

Self-Exclusion: Voluntarily ban yourself from casino platforms for set periods (6 months, 1 year, 5 years, permanent). During exclusion, you cannot access your account.

Cooling-Off Periods: Short breaks (24 hours to 30 days) from gaming. Less permanent than self-exclusion.

Reality Checks: Pop-up reminders showing how long you've played and current balance.

Activity Statements: Review your gaming history, deposits, withdrawals, and net results.

Account Closure: Permanently close your account if needed.

Healthy Gaming Habits:

Before Playing:
- Set time and money limits
- Ensure you're in good mental state
- Don't play when emotional, stressed, or intoxicated
- Have other activities planned for after

During Play:

- Keep track of time spent
- Never borrow to continue playing
