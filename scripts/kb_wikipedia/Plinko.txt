Plinko by BGaming is a modern take on the classic game show favorite, offering a 99% RTP and simple yet addictive gameplay. This social casino game perfectly blends luck and excitement as you watch a ball bounce down a pyramid of pegs.

How to Play:
Choose your risk level (low, medium, or high) and the number of rows (8-16). Drop the ball from the top and watch it bounce unpredictably through the pegs. The ball lands in one of the multiplier slots at the bottom, determining your win.

Risk Levels Explained:
- Low Risk: More consistent wins with lower multipliers. Great for beginners who want steady gameplay. Maximum multipliers are moderate but hit more frequently.

- Medium Risk: Balanced gameplay with a good mix of small and medium wins. The middle path for players who want excitement without extreme volatility.

- High Risk: Maximum volatility with the potential for huge multipliers (up to 1000x) but also more frequent losses. The edge multipliers offer the biggest rewards.

Row Selection Strategy:
More rows (16) create more unpredictable bounces and larger multiplier spreads. Fewer rows (8) mean quicker games with more predictable patterns. Most experienced players prefer 12-16 rows for maximum excitement.

The Math Behind Plinko:
Each peg bounce is independent, creating a Galton board effect. The ball statistically tends toward the center multipliers, but the beauty of Plinko is that any drop can result in an edge multiplier hit.

Why Players Choose Plinko:
The satisfaction of watching each bounce combined with adjustable risk levels makes Plinko perfect for all player types. The 99% RTP is among the highest in social casino games, offering excellent value.

Pro Tips:
Start with low risk to understand the game mechanics. Switch to high risk only when comfortable with volatility. Some players use auto-play to enjoy the visual spectacle of multiple balls dropping simultaneously.
