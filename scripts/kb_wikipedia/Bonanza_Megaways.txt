Bonanza by Big Time Gaming is the slot that started the Megaways revolution. Released in 2016, it introduced the world to dynamic reel systems and up to 117,649 ways to win. Often called the "original Megaways," it remains one of the most influential slots ever created.

Game Mechanics:
6 reels with 2-7 symbols each, plus a horizontal reel above reels 2-5. The number of symbols changes every spin, creating between 324 and 117,649 ways to win. Cascading reels remove wins and drop new symbols.

RTP and Volatility:
96% RTP with high volatility. The combination of Megaways variance and unlimited multiplier free spins creates significant swings.

Theme and Design:
Gold mining adventure set in a mountain quarry. Minecarts, dynamite, and gemstones fill the reels. The rustic mining aesthetic perfectly matches the "digging for gold" excitement of chasing big wins.

Megaways Explained:
Each reel randomly shows 2-7 symbols per spin. Ways to win calculated by multiplying symbols per reel:
- Minimum: 2×2×2×2×2×2 = 64 ways
- Maximum: 7×7×7×7×7×7 = 117,649 ways

More ways = more potential winning combinations.

Symbols:
- Gemstones (red, purple, green, blue): High value
- Card royals (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9): Lower value
- Dynamite: Wild symbol
- G-O-L-D letters: Scatter (spell GOLD for bonus)

Cascading Wins (Reactions):
When you win:
1. Winning symbols explode
2. Remaining symbols fall
3. New symbols fill empty spaces
4. Process repeats while wins continue

This can create chain reactions of multiple wins from single spin.

Free Spins Trigger:
Land G-O-L-D scatter letters (one per reel 2, 3, 4, 5):
- Spelling GOLD: 12 free spins
- Extra scatters: +5 spins each
- Can also trigger from 4+ scatters anywhere

The feature that makes Bonanza legendary:
- Starts at 1x multiplier
- Every cascade increases multiplier by 1x

- Can retrigger with 3+ scatters (+5 spins)

Example multiplier growth:
- Win cascade 1: 1x
- Win cascade 2: 2x
- Win cascade 3: 3x
- After 20 cascades: 21x multiplier on all wins

Maximum Win:
Up to 10,000x+ bet through accumulated multipliers. Extended free spins with consistent cascades create the biggest wins.

Carts Feature (Base Game):
The horizontal reel above main reels can land:
- Extra symbols increasing ways
- Gold bars adding to potential

Strategy Considerations:
1. Base game provides steady entertainment
