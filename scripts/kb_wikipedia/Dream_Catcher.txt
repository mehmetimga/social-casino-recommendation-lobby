Dream Catcher by Evolution Gaming pioneered the live casino game show format that revolutionized the industry. This colorful money wheel game combines the simplicity of a carnival wheel with live dealer entertainment, making it the perfect introduction to live casino gaming.

Game Concept:
Dream Catcher features a giant vertical wheel (2.2 meters tall) divided into 54 segments. A professional live host spins the wheel, and players bet on which number segment the wheel will stop at. The wheel is broadcast live from Evolution's state-of-the-art studio in HD quality.

Number Segments:
- Number 1: 23 segments (pays 1:1)
- Number 2: 15 segments (pays 2:1)
- Number 5: 7 segments (pays 5:1)
- Number 10: 4 segments (pays 10:1)
- Number 20: 2 segments (pays 20:1)
- Number 40: 1 segment (pays 40:1)
- Multiplier x2: 1 segment
- Multiplier x7: 1 segment

How to Play:
1. Place bets on any number (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 40)
2. Betting closes when the host spins the wheel
3. Wheel spins and gradually slows down
4. Flexible flapper on top determines the winning segment
5. Winning bets are paid according to the odds

Multiplier Feature:
When the wheel lands on a multiplier segment (x2 or x7), the wheel is spun again. Whatever number wins on the next spin has its payout multiplied by that amount. If another multiplier lands, they stack multiplicatively.

Example: Wheel lands on x2, then spins again and lands on x7, then spins again and stops on number 10. The payout would be 10 × 2 × 7 = 140:1.

The multipliers can create explosive wins, especially when they stack before landing on high-value segments like 20 or 40.

RTP: 96.58%

Betting Strategy:
- Conservative: Bet on 1 or 2 for frequent wins with lower variance
- Balanced: Spread bets across 1, 2, and 5 for mix of frequency and value
- Aggressive: Target 10, 20, or 40 for rare but big wins
- Multiplier Hunting: Bet heavily on high numbers when multipliers hit

Many players use combination bets, covering multiple numbers to increase win frequency while maintaining some upside potential on high-value segments.

Studio Experience:
Dream Catcher is broadcast from a brightly colored, carnival-themed studio. Professional hosts keep the game entertaining with commentary, interact with players via chat, and create an engaging atmosphere. The massive wheel, dramatic lighting, and enthusiastic hosts make every spin exciting.

Social Element:
Live chat allows players to interact with the host and each other. This community aspect makes Dream Catcher more than just gambling - it's entertainment. The host calls out player names, celebrates wins, and builds relationships with regular players.
