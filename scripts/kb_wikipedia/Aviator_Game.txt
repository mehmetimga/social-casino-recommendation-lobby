Aviator is an exciting crash game developed by Spribe with a 97% RTP (Return to Player). This innovative social casino game has become extremely popular for its simple yet thrilling gameplay.

How to Play Aviator:
The game features a plane that takes off and flies higher and higher. As the plane ascends, a multiplier increases from 1x upwards. Players must cash out before the plane flies away. The challenge is deciding when to cash out - wait too long and you lose your bet, cash out too early and you miss bigger wins.

Key Features:
- Real-time multiplier that can reach incredible heights
- Instant cashout feature for quick decisions
- Auto-cashout option to set predetermined exit points
- Provably fair algorithm ensures transparent outcomes
- Fast-paced rounds lasting just seconds
- Social element with live player statistics

Strategy Tips:
Start with conservative cashouts around 1.5x-2x to build confidence. Many experienced players use auto-cashout at moderate multipliers like 2x or 3x for consistent wins. Avoid chasing huge multipliers as the plane can fly away at any moment.

Why Players Love Aviator:
The adrenaline rush of watching the multiplier climb combined with the social aspect of seeing other players' bets makes Aviator incredibly engaging. The transparency of provably fair gaming gives players confidence in every round.
