Volatility: High
Max Win: 21,100x your bet

Tumble Feature:
After every win, winning symbols explode in a burst of candy effects, making room for new symbols to drop from above. Consecutive tumbles can occur in a single paid spin, with each cascade offering new winning opportunities. Tumbles continue until no new wins form.

Multiplier Bombs:
The special feature is the Multiplier Bomb symbols (lollipops) that can land randomly. When a bomb lands, it awards a random multiplier of 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 8x, 10x, 12x, 15x, 20x, 25x, 50x, or even 100x. If multiple bombs land, their multipliers are added together before being applied to the total win.

Free Spins:
Landing 4+ scatter symbols (colorful lollipop) triggers 10 free spins. During free spins, Multiplier Bombs are collected and added to a persistent multiplier that applies to all subsequent wins during the feature. This is where the massive wins occur.

Example: Landing bombs with multipliers of 5x, 10x, 25x, and 50x during free spins creates a running total of 90x that applies to every win from that point forward. Additional bombs continue adding to this multiplier throughout the bonus.

Free spins retrigger with 3+ scatters, awarding 5 additional spins. Some lucky players have achieved 100+ total free spins through repeated retriggers.

Ante Bet Feature:
Pay 25% extra per spin (1.25x bet) to double your chances of triggering free spins. This option is popular among players who want more frequent bonus action.

Bonus Buy:
Purchase free spins instantly for 100x your bet. The bought bonus has identical mechanics and RTP to naturally triggered features, making it a favorite for impatient players and streamers.

Visual Appeal:
The bright, cheerful aesthetic makes Sweet Bonanza family-friendly and appealing to casual players. Symbols burst with satisfying animations, creating a dopamine-triggering visual experience. The upbeat soundtrack complements the happy theme perfectly.

Why It's Beloved:
Sweet Bonanza takes the stress out of high volatility with its cheerful presentation. The multiplier accumulation system is easy to understand but deeply engaging. Watching multipliers stack up during free spins creates intense excitement, especially when high-value symbols appear with massive multipliers applied.

Record Wins:
