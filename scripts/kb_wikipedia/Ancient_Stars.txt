Ancient Stars fuses astronomical wonder with archaeological mystery, taking players to ancient observatories where civilizations mapped the heavens and hid celestial treasures. This unique slot combines star-charting mechanics with ancient civilization themes.

Game Mechanics:
6 reels, 5 rows with Megaways mechanics - the number of symbols per reel changes each spin, creating between 324 and 46,656 ways to win. Winning symbols cascade away and new symbols fall into place. Consecutive cascades increase a multiplier.

RTP and Volatility:
Ancient Stars offers 96.5% RTP with very high volatility. The Megaways variance combined with unlimited multipliers creates potential for life-changing wins alongside inevitable cold streaks.

Celestial Symbols:
Ancient astronomers, golden astrolabes, star charts, and constellation symbols fill the reels. Each of the 12 zodiac constellations appears as a special symbol. The North Star is the wild, and the Eclipse symbol is the scatter.

Star Chart Collection:
A star chart grid sits beside the main reels. Landing zodiac symbols lights up corresponding positions on the chart. Complete constellation patterns to unlock different rewards:
- Small constellations (3 stars): Instant coin prizes
- Medium constellations (5 stars): Free spin packages
- Large constellations (8+ stars): Multiplier boosts and jackpots

Cascade Multiplier:
Each consecutive cascade win increases the multiplier by 1x with no upper limit. Base game multipliers reset after the cascade sequence ends, but free spin multipliers persist throughout the entire bonus.

Eclipse Free Spins:
Landing 4 or more Eclipse scatters triggers free spins. The number of scatters determines starting spins (4 scatters = 12 spins, 5+ = 20 spins). During free spins, the cascade multiplier never resets, building throughout the entire bonus.

Supernova Feature:
Randomly during any spin, a Supernova explosion can transform all low-paying symbols into a single matching high-paying symbol, setting up massive winning potential.

Ancient Observatory Bonus:
Complete the full 12-constellation star chart to enter the Ancient Observatory bonus. This end-game feature offers a choice of three celestial prizes, each multiplied by your total star chart progress.

Visual and Audio:
Breathtaking night sky backgrounds with accurate constellation patterns. Ancient stone observatory setting with mystical star magic effects. Ethereal ambient soundtrack with celestial chimes.

Ancient Stars offers maximum win potential of 25,000x your bet, achievable through extended free spin sessions with high cascade multipliers and full Megaways expansion.
