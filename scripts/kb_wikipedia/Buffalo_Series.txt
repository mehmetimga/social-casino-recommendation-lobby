The Buffalo slot series by Aristocrat is one of the most successful slot franchises in history. Originating in land-based casinos, the original Buffalo (2006) introduced the "Xtra Reel Power" system and became so popular it spawned dozens of variants played by millions worldwide.

Game Legacy:
Buffalo is the slot that made "243 ways to win" mainstream. Before Buffalo, most slots used traditional paylines. Its success proved players embraced new mechanics, influencing the entire industry.

Original Buffalo Mechanics:
5 reels, 4 rows, 1024 ways to win (Reel Power system). No paylines - win by matching symbols on adjacent reels from left to right. This revolutionary approach became industry standard.

RTP and Volatility:
94-96% RTP (varies by version and venue) with medium-high volatility. Land-based versions typically have lower RTP than online counterparts.

Theme and Design:
North American wilderness featuring iconic animals. The majestic buffalo leads a cast of wildlife including eagles, wolves, cougars, and elk. Sunset backgrounds and natural sounds create authentic atmosphere.

Symbol Hierarchy:
- Buffalo: Highest value, can appear stacked
- Eagle: High value
- Wolf: High value
- Cougar: Medium-high value
